Project Overview

We are working on a project that involves automating the retrieval and processing of flat files from a vendor’s FTP server. Previously, this process was manual, requiring us to upload files via an endpoint and then process all the records. The goal is to streamline and automate this workflow by directly connecting to the FTP server, automatically retrieving files, and processing them when they are updated at the source.

Libraries Used

•	FluentFTP: This .NET library provides a simple and efficient way to manage FTP operations. It's configured with the FTP host, username, and password, and can traverse directories recursively to download and process each file.

•	Azure.Storage.Blobs: This library is used for interacting with Azure Blob Storage, allowing us to upload files from the FTP server to Azure Blob Storage.

•	BackgroundService: The code runs as a background service using BackgroundService in .NET, which ensures continuous operation and can be scheduled to run at specific intervals.

Current Implementation

The current implementation of the service performs the following tasks:

1.	FTP Connection: The service connects to the FTP server using the credentials provided.
2.	Directory Traversal: It recursively traverses directories on the FTP server, identifying files that need to be processed.
3.	File Processing: For each identified file, it downloads the file to a memory stream and uploads it to Azure Blob Storage.
4.	Scheduling: The process runs on a set interval, ensuring files are regularly checked and processed.
Areas of Improvement
1.	Concurrency Handling:
o	The current implementation does not handle concurrent processing, which can lead to race conditions if multiple files are processed simultaneously. Improvements are needed to ensure that concurrent uploads and processing are handled safely and efficiently.
2.	Error Handling and Logging:
o	While basic error handling is in place, there's a need for more robust logging practices. This includes logging all errors and exceptions with sufficient detail to diagnose issues effectively, and possibly incorporating structured logging for better insights.
3.	Configuration Settings:
o	Sensitive data such as FTP credentials and Azure Blob connection strings should be stored securely, using a configuration system like Azure Key Vault or environment variables to avoid hard-coding sensitive information in the code.
4.	Blob Storage Features:
o	Leveraging additional Azure Blob Storage features like metadata would be beneficial. For example, metadata can be used to track the status of each job (e.g., how many files have been processed, whether a file has been processed before, how many records in a file were processed) for better traceability and error recovery.
5.	Polling Scheduler:
o	Implementing a robust polling mechanism that triggers file processing at specified intervals can help avoid overlapping executions and ensure that each file is processed exactly once, even if the file processing takes longer than expected.
6.	Retry Logic and Resilience:
o	Implementing retry logic for transient errors, especially in network operations or blob uploads, will increase the resilience of the service against temporary failures.
7.	Memory and Performance Optimization:
o	Since the current implementation uses memory streams for file handling, there may be opportunities to optimize memory usage, particularly for handling large files. Using a memory pool or streaming directly to blob storage without fully loading the file into memory could be considered.


Next Steps

•	Implement Concurrency Control: Introduce locks, queues, or other concurrency control mechanisms to manage concurrent processing safely.

•	Enhance Logging: Implement structured logging and ensure all critical operations and errors are logged with context.

•	Secure Configuration: Move all sensitive configuration settings to a secure storage solution.

•	Metadata Utilization: Define and use blob metadata to keep track of file processing status.

•	Refine Scheduler: Adjust the scheduling logic to better handle long-running tasks and avoid overlap.

•	Optimize Performance: Review and optimize memory usage, potentially using streaming or memory pooling techniques.


Logging with Scopes

Overview: Logging with scopes allows you to add contextual information to all logs generated within a specific code block. This is particularly useful for debugging and gaining better insights into application behavior, as it adds additional properties to all logs within the scope, making it easier to identify and correlate log entries.

Benefits:
•	Contextual Information: Logs within the scope inherit properties that can help trace issues more effectively.
•	Correlated Logs: Easier identification of related log entries, especially useful in complex systems or when handling multiple requests concurrently.
Implementation: To use logging with scopes in .NET, you can create a logging scope like this:
using (_logger.BeginScope("ScopeName: {ScopeValue}", scopeValue))
{
    _logger.LogInformation("This log entry will include the scope context.");
}

Application Telemetry Logging

Overview: Application telemetry provides extensive logging capabilities and is particularly beneficial in microservices architectures. It offers built-in features for health checks, diagnostics, and real-time monitoring by reading directly from the application configuration.
Key Features:

•	Centralized Logging: Collects logs from multiple services into a single Application Insights instance, helping to track and identify issues across services.
•	Service Initializer: Allows you to tag logs with service-specific information, making it easier to filter and analyze logs per service.
•	Kusto Query Language (KQL): Provides powerful querying capabilities to extract insights from logs, such as identifying who made a request, the source of the request, what information was accessed, and the success of the operation.
•	Dependency Tracking: Automatically tracks dependencies like external API calls or database queries, associating them with an operation ID for easier traceability.
Logging Levels:

•	Error: Indicates a failure in the application that should be addressed.
•	Information: General information about the application's operation. This is the default log level and logs all levels above it.
•	Debug: Detailed diagnostic information, primarily used during development.
•	Trace: Finer-grained informational events than the Debug level.
•	Critical: Critical errors causing complete failure of the application.
Customizing Log Levels: Log levels can be adjusted in production environments to balance between the granularity of the logs and the performance impact. For instance, in higher environments, you might reduce the verbosity of logs by setting the level to Error or Critical.
Alerts in Application Insights:
•	Threshold Alerts: You can configure alerts to trigger when certain conditions are met, such as when a specific number of exceptions occur within a given time frame.
•	Dependency Alerts: Alerts can be set up for dependencies (e.g., Cosmos DB), where changes in response structure or performance can trigger notifications.
Example Use Case:
•	If a dependency like Cosmos DB encounters a schema change that causes multiple exceptions, you can configure an alert to notify the team, allowing them to investigate and address the issue promptly.
